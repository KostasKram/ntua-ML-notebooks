# Machine Learning

Jupyter notebooks for the Machine Learning course's lab at Ece Ntua 2023-24.


## Lab 1 - Machine Learning Classification Algorithms

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive comparison of various machine learning algorithms for their effectiveness in data classification. We will explore and evaluate the performance of a diverse set of classifiers, including Naive Bayes, KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, MLP with a single hidden layer, SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Through rigorous training, validation, and optimization, we will identify the algorithm that delivers the most accurate and interpretable results for the given dataset.


## Lab2 - Hyperspectral Image Analysis with Machine Learning
This project implements a series of machine learning algorithms for analyzing hyperspectral images. It starts by loading and visualizing the image, followed by extracting spectral signatures. Next, k-means and PCA are applied for clustering and dimensionality reduction respectively. Finally, we explore combining PCA and k-means for optimized analysis.

All notebook reports are in Greek language.
